## Background

Since I started developing with Node.js I really loved the modularity of the usual node development flow. You usually just need to pull a repo (or scaffold a project with yeoman) and you're good to go on your local machine, without a full fledged webserver, and with a lovely dependency management. And when you're ready to go online? Well you just deploy your package or sort of. 
Since I'm also a huge WordPress fan, I tried to reproduce a similar flow with my favorite CMS, so here we are. Hope you enjoy it ;)

## Key features

* Git-friendly
* Dependency management via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* Instant local development webserver with [Rack'em](http://ripeworks.com/rackem/)
* Deployable and versionable DB thanks to [SQLite Integration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqlite-integration/) (WordPress Plugin)
