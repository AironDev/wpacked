## Background

Since I started developing with Node.js I really loved the modularity of the usual node development flow. You usually just need to pull a repo (or scaffold a project with yeoman) and you're good to go on your local machine, without a full fledged webserver, and with a lovely dependency management. And when you're ready to go online? Well you just deploy your package or sort of. 
Since I'm also a huge WordPress fan, I tried to reproduce a similar flow with my favorite CMS, so here we are. Hope you enjoy it ;)
